<h2 id="instructional-format">Instructional Format</h2>
<p>Components of the course will be taught synchronously in-person, with remote streaming options available at the beginning of the semester, with asynchronous remote lessons mixed in, as well.</p>
<h3 id="required-in-person-days">Required In-person Days</h3>
<p>Quizzes and examinations are offered in-person only this semester. The format is pencil and paper. We will provide the quizzes/exams/paper, you only need to bring pencils, a good eraser, and your ONECard to quizzes and exams.</p>
<p>If you have examination accommodations via ARS, please go ahead and schedule exams for these dates that coincide with your section’s time. For the final exam, you may schedule a 9am start.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="office-hours-and-tutoring-in-person">Office Hours and Tutoring In-person</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most useful resources in COMP110 are office hours and tutoring. These resources expect in-person, face-to-face attendance and will not be available remotely.</p>
<h3 id="comp110-remote-asynchronous-dates">COMP110 Remote Asynchronous Dates</h3>
<p>The following dates are planned to be asynchronous and remote with prerecorded lessons introducing new topics. As you’ll notice, the general plan once we get into the semester is for Tuesdays to be asynchronous and Thursdays to be synchronous.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/13 - Thursday</li>
<li>1/18 - Tuesday</li>
<li>1/25 - Tuesday</li>
<li>2/1 - Tuesday</li>
<li>2/8 - Tuesday</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="face-masks-in-hamilton-100">Face Masks in Hamilton 100</h3>
<p>This semester, while we are in the midst of a global pandemic, all enrolled students are required to wear a mask covering your mouth and nose at all times in our classroom. This requirement is to protect our educational community — your classmates and me – as we learn together. If you choose not to wear a mask, or wear it improperly, I or a member of the course staff will ask you to leave immediately, and I will submit a report to the Office of Student Conduct. At that point you will be disenrolled from this course for the protection of our educational community. Students who have an authorized accommodation from Accessibility Resources and Service have an exception. For additional information, see <a href="https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/">Carolina Together</a>.</p>
<h3 id="classroom-etiquitte-in-hamilton-100">Classroom Etiquitte in Hamilton 100</h3>
<p>Please respect your fellow students by maintaining proper etiquette in class; this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not arriving late habitually or leaving in the midst of class;</li>
<li>Not talking, sleeping, reading other material etc. in class;</li>
<li>Keeping cellphones, etc. off during class;</li>
<li>PLEASE DO NOT use your laptop to surf the web, watch Netflix, iMessage, use Instagram, Tik Tok, etc. during in-person meetings;</li>
<li>If you are being disruptive in class the instructor reserves the right to ask you to leave.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attending-in-person-lectures-remotely">Attending In-person Lectures Remotely</h3>
<p>In-person lectures will be live streamed and recorded for the first few weeks of the semester. If you cannot physically attend class due to quarantining after contracting COVID, you can watch lecture and participate remotely via the stream URL posted to the course site.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>I value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students. I broadly define diversity to include race, gender identity, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political background, and physical and learning ability. I strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve, I appreciate suggestions.</p>
<h2 id="textbooks-and-resources">Textbooks and Resources</h2>
<p>The course web page is the primary resource for this course. There is no textbook for COMP110. We will distribute occasional readings, reference material, and tutorials via the course website and e-mail announcements.</p>
<h2 id="course-description-target-audience-and-prerequisites">Course Description, Target Audience, and Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Introduces students to programming and data science from a computational perspective. With an emphasis on modern applications in society, students gain experience with problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, abstraction design, and ethics in computing. No prior programming experience expected. Foundational concepts include data types, sequences, boolean logic, control flow, functions/methods, classes/objects, input/output, data organization, transformations, and visualizations.</p>
<p>Pre-requisite: A C or better in one of the following courses: MATH 130, 152, 210, 231, 129P, or PHIL 155, or STOR 112, 113, 120, 151, 155.</p>
<h2 id="goals-and-key-learning-objectives">Goals and Key Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>This course is intended to teach basic computer programming skills to students ranging from those with no prior programming experience to those with some prior experience. This course aims to teach general programming language concepts and semantics, problem definition, problem solving, logical and recursive thinking, through algorithm development and writing programs. Additionally, the course offers broad exposure to some of today’s key issues of computing in society.</p>
<h2 id="course-load-expectation">Course Load Expectation</h2>
<p>COMP110 is a rigorous introductory STEM course. Learning how to program is an acquired, practiced skill much like playing a musical instrument or learning a new craft. The amount of time you individually spend practicing programing and working on assignments, outside of any other help, will significantly impact your success in the course. You should expect to spend 2.5 hours per week on lecture and async lessons ON TOP OF about 9 hours per week outside of lecture working on assignments and studying. We DO NOT recommended taking COMP110 in a semester when you are enrolled in 17 or more credit hours.</p>
<h2 id="course-requirements-and-policies">Course Requirements and Policies</h2>
<p>You should complete all asynchronous lessons and related questions on time. You should attend all synchronous lessons (all days except those shown above) and check the course page for announcements and updates. You should complete all programming and reading assignments on time.</p>
<p>For in-person lectures, please show up at least five minutes early so that the class can begin promptly at 11:00am.</p>
<h2 id="final-exam---april-30th-800am---1100am">Final Exam - April 30th 8:00am - 11:00am</h2>
<p>Both sections have a Common Hour Exam on April 30th, 2022 at 8:00am. If you have a regularly scheduled course during the 8:00am Tue/Thu time slot, then that exam will take precedence over COMP110 and you will need to take the COMP110 exam during the make-up time on Sunday, May 1st at 10:00am. The course final is given in compliance with the UNC final exam regulations and according to the UNC Final Exam calendar.</p>
<h2 id="grading-criteria">Grading Criteria</h2>
<p>To do well in this course you must come to your own individual mastery of introductory programming concepts and engage with broader intellectual questions of computing in society. Final grades are calculated with the following weights for each course component:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% - Preparation, Practice, Participation
<ul>
<li>30% - Programming Exercises / Projects</li>
<li>10% - 3x Reading Responses</li>
<li>10% - Lesson Responses on Gradescope (Graded for Correctness)
<ul>
<li>0% - In-lecture Polling Questions (Practice)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>50% - Mastery
<ul>
<li>40% - 4x Quizzes</li>
<li>10% - Final Exam</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The fairest way to assess mastery of material while distance learning is through a combination of timed assessments, excercises with “on your own” sections, and open-ended project work.</p>
<p>Taking at least three of the four quizzes and the final exam is required to be eligible to pass COMP110.</p>
<p>The cumulative final exam is worth 50% of your final grade at the start of the term. Each quiz you take accounts for 10% of your final grade and reduces the weight of your final examination by 10%. There are no drops.</p>
<p>For example: By taking all 4 quizzes, your final exam’s weight is 10% of your final grade. If you must be absent from a quiz (see policy below), then the three quizzes you take will account for 30% of your final grade and your final exam will account for 20%.</p>
<p>If, and only if, you take all four quizzes and your final examination score exceeds your lowest quiz score, then we will retroactively grant you an absence for the lowest quiz score and your final exam score will be worth 20%.</p>
<h2 id="quiz-absence-policy">Quiz Absence Policy</h2>
<p>The quizzes will be held during the section you are registered for and are synchronous, in-person for both sections 001 and 002. These dates, and the final exam date, are required synchronous dates for section 001.</p>
<p>You may be absent for up to one quiz. To request absence from a quiz, you should submit this form <em>before</em> your absence: <a href="https://bit.ly/comp110-absence-sp22" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/comp110-absence-sp22</a>.</p>
<p>To ensure these assessments are fair for all students enrolled in COMP110 this term, we do can only offer quiz makeups for <a href="https://uaao.unc.edu/university-approved-absences-request/">university approved absences</a>. Merely being absent from a quiz that does not qualify for a makeup, the quiz’s 10% credit will simply not be drawn down from your final exam score’s weight. As such, this is not a penalty; your mastery of this quiz’ material will be assessed on the cumulative final exam.</p>
<p>We can offer everyone absent from a quiz the same learning experience of sitting for the quiz at some later date and receiving feedback on it, but a quiz taken in this fashion is not for credit and will not count toward nor against your mastery grade to ensure fairness to all students.</p>
<h2 id="covid-absence-and-quarantine-policy">COVID Absence and Quarantine Policy</h2>
<p>Please be fully vaccinated for COVID for the safety of yourself, your peers, and your instructional staff.</p>
<p>This course will operate in accordance with the CDC and Campus Health advisories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html">CDC Advisories</a></li>
<li><a href="https://campushealth.unc.edu/services/covid-19-service-details-and-faqs/">Campus Health Advisories</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you learn you are exposed to someone with COVID this semester, but do not test positive yourself, assuming you are fully up-to-date on your COVID vaccinations, the CDC and UNC guidelines have been updated to advise <em>masking</em> for the following 10-days; you do not need to quarantine. Since you will be wearing a mask in all course settings, extensions and makeups for COVID will only be granted to those who have a University Approved Absence.</p>
<p>If you test positive for COVID this semester and are medically ordered to isolate by health practitioners, you are expected to recover and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html">quarantine per UNC and CDC guidelines</a> and <a href="https://uaao.unc.edu/absences-related-to-covid-19/">notify Campus Health</a>. If your symptoms prevent you from staying up to date with the course remotely, or isolation causes you to miss a quiz, we will grant extensions and quiz makeups to those who are granted a University Approved Absence: <a href="https://uaao.unc.edu/absences-related-to-covid-19/" class="uri">https://uaao.unc.edu/absences-related-to-covid-19/</a></p>
<h2 id="course-passage-policy">Course Passage Policy</h2>
<p>In order to pass COMP110, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a passing grade given the rubric of weights above and grading scale below,</li>
<li>Take at least 3 quizzes,</li>
<li>Score greater than 40% on the final exam.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="honor-code-and-collaboration-policy">Honor Code and Collaboration Policy</h2>
<p>In order to do well in this course, you must come to your own individual understanding of the material. As such, collaboration is prohibited outside of the following policies.</p>
<p>Make sure that you are familiar with The UNC Honor Code. You will be required to sign an Honor Code pledge to hand in with every quiz and the final as well as “sign” the code you submit for grading by filling in your PID in the required <code>__author__</code> variable. Failing to do so may result in no credit assigned for the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-policy-on-ungraded-general-course-concepts">Collaboration Policy on Ungraded, General Course Concepts</h3>
<p>You absolutely may, and are encouraged to, discuss general course concepts (i.e. not assignment-specific) material with anyone, including other current students and tutors. This includes going over lecture slides, documentation, code examples covered in lecture, study guides, etc. The examples you use to discuss general course materials must be from lecture or your own creativity, you cannot use examples directly drawn from any assignments handed in.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-on-graded-work">Collaboration on Graded Work</h3>
<p>No collaboration with peers inside the course, or anyone outside the course, with the exception of our course TAs while they are working as a TA, is allowed on exercises, projects, lecture assignments, quizzes, and exams. Your ability to complete each individually is critical for your ability to do well in this course. Illegal collaboration is easily detected in COMP110 because Gradescope has built-in support for Stanford’s MOSS program (Measures of Software Similarity), as well as other machine learning techniques. Every year, a number of violations are caught and prosecuted in the Honor Court, so far always resulting in guilty convictions and sanctions. Avoiding any fears here is simple: work on assignments and assessments on your own and come to office hours when you have questions. Please note that if you know someone who is a UTA, you are only permitted to receive help from them while they are working in their official capacity. Receiving help from a UTA outside of their working hours is considered an unfair advantage for academic gain and is an honor code violation.</p>
<h3 id="permitted-resources-on-graded-work">Permitted Resources on Graded Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Materials on the course website and any linked resources</li>
<li>Instruction received from UTAs</li>
<li>Official programming language documentation</li>
<li>Online documentation for specific errors you encounter</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are not permitted resources on coursework handed in for credit and are considered honor code violations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking for help on an assignment or assessment on GroupMe, or any other mobile or web application, groupchat, or forum.</li>
<li>Talking about specific assignments with peers in the course or anyone outside the course with the exception of UTAs.</li>
<li>Looking at someone else’s screen, whether in person or shared remotely, while working on a an assignment. Letting someone else look at or share your screen.</li>
<li>Copying code found on any website or community such as StackOverflow, Github, Chegg, or CourseHero.</li>
<li>Sharing or reusing code with any peer currently in the course or anyone who has previously taken the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, ask me.</p>
<h3 id="tutors-and-informal-help-from-comp-friends">Tutors and Informal Help from COMP Friends</h3>
<p>Tutors, tutoring organizations, and COMP friends <strong>are not allowed</strong> to help you with any assignments handed in for credit. They may help you with general course concept questions, however we encourage you to rely on TA assistance foremost.</p>
<h2 id="code-review-test">Code Review Test</h2>
<p>I reserve the right to, at any time, ask you to submit to a “code review” test with me or a head TA. We may ask you to meet to explain any line of code or decision made in your program that we deem suspicious or confusing. Thus, you should be able to comfortably explain why you (and you alone) wrote any single line of code in an assignment handed in for credit. Should you be unable to do so, your grade will be a zero for the assignment in question and you may be taken to honor court depending on the severity of the infraction.</p>
<h3 id="autograding-and-resubmissions">Autograding and Resubmissions</h3>
<p>Grades on programming assignments have two components: autograded points and manually graded points. You should take note of how many autograded vs. manually graded points there are ahead of submission. You are permitted, and encouraged, to resubmit your programming assignments as many times as you need in order to earn full credit on the autograded points of an assignment. There is no penalty for resubmission. The autograder will run and assign a score within a few minutes of submission. We will not go back and manually assign any credit for autograder points you failed to earn, so you can know and be aware of your autograded points upon submission. If you do not understand the error output of some autograded point deduction, please come see us in office hours!</p>
<h3 id="early-submission-of-programming-assignments">Early submission of programming assignments</h3>
<p>Programming assignments (exercises and projects) whose final submission is made 48 hours, or more, before their deadline will receive a 5% early hand-in bonus on the assignment’s autograded score. Submissions that fall within the early window of 24-48 hours before the deadline will receive a 3% early hand-in bonus. Submissions made within 24 hours of the deadline are not subject to any bonus. The early hand-in bonus does not apply to manually graded points on projects.</p>
<h3 id="late-policies">Late policies</h3>
<p>All assignments, outside of assessments such as quizzes and the final exam, will have an 11:59pm deadline on their due date.</p>
<p>Lesson responses, programming projects, and exercises will all have deadlines and late periods. After the late period begins, there is a 1-hour grace period in which no penalty is applied. Beyond that grace period, the following policies apply:</p>
<p>Lesson responses on Gradescope are typically assigned on lecture days (Tu/Th) and must be completed before 11:59pm the following day. After the 1-hour grace period described above, a 15% late penalty will be applied at the end of the semester. No lesson responses will be accepted beyond 11:59pm two days following their original deadline. To ensure fairness to everyone, as emergencies may arise, we will drop the three lowest lesson response scores, including zeros.</p>
<p>Programming and reading assignments - submissions made after the deadline, outside of the 1-hour grace period described above, will have a 15% late penalty applied at the end of the semester. Exercises and projects cannot be handed in beyond their 7-day late period, which follows the original deadline.</p>
<h3 id="late-point-forgiveness-insurance">Late Point Forgiveness Insurance</h3>
<p>As “insurance” against illness, computer crashes, conflicts with other coursework, etc., every student in the course is forgiven 60 points worth of late penalties on assignments at the end of the term. Like real insurance, there is no reward for not needing to use these points and you should try to avoid using them outside of unpredictable, emergency situations like a computer needing repair. These points will first be applied to late penalties on programming assignments and, assuming there are points leftover, will then be applied to late penalties on lesson responses.</p>
<h2 id="grading-scale-breakdown">Grading Scale Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li>A: 93-100</li>
<li>A-: 90-92</li>
<li>B+: 87-89</li>
